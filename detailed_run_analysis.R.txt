##Download the UCI HAR Dataset and move the folder to your working directory
##Load all of the necessary files into R

activity_labels <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", quote="\"")
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", quote="\"")
subject_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", quote="\"")
X_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", quote="\"")
y_test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", quote="\"")
subject_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", quote="\"")
X_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", quote="\"")
y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", quote="\"")
-----

##All the files are now loaded into R. Now it's time to construct the initial data frame

##Use cbind to construct the data frame of test data
testdf <- cbind(subject_test, y_test, X_test)

##Use cbind to construct the data frame for train data
traindf <- cbind(subject_train, y_train, X_train)

##Use rbind to combine the two data frames into one large data frame
completedf <- rbind(testdf, traindf)
-----

##Now you should have a full data frame
##Next step is to fill in the variable names

##First convert the activities in the features data frame to a name variable
names <- make.names(features$V2, unique = TRUE)

##Now change the first column to "subject", the second column to "activity", and the rest will be filled with the new names variable will fill the rest
##"subject" and "activity" are just used to make more sense of the first two columns
colnames(completedf) <- c("subject", "activity", names)
-----
##Now fix the activity column so that the numbers are replaced with the activity labels

##First change the column class from numeric to factor
completedf$activity <- as.factor(completedf$activity)

##Now replace the levels with the levels from the activity column (replacing numbers with their appropriate labels)
levels(completedf$activity) <- levels(activity_labels$V2)
-----
##Now subest the columns of the data frame to only columns regarding mean and standard deviation. Use the grep function

##Make a list of all the column numbers that have the word "mean"
means <- grep("mean", colnames(completedf))

##Make a list of all the column names that have the word "std"
sds <- grep("std", colnames(completedf))

##Make a new data frame with the subject column, activity column, and columns relating to mean and std
completedf2 <- completedf[,c(1:2, means,sds)]
-----
##Now make a new data frame with the coumn averages by activity
##This piece of code is very long and looks awkward when copied and pasted into R, but it will work just fine
##The code makes a data frame with the first column being the activity labels. 
##The next column is actually a matrix made up of an rbind of column means by activity
##Each row of coumn means uses the colMeans function and subsets the completeddf2 by rows featuring the activity name

completedf3 <- data.frame(activity_labels$V2, 
(rbind((colMeans(completedf2[which(completedf2$activity == "WALKING"), 3:81])), 
(colMeans(completedf2[which(completedf2$activity == "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"), 3:81])), 
(colMeans(completedf2[which(completedf2$activity == "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"), 3:81])), 
(colMeans(completedf2[which(completedf2$activity == "SITTING"), 3:81])), 
(colMeans(completedf2[which(completedf2$activity == "STANDING"), 3:81])), 
(colMeans(completedf2[which(completedf2$activity == "LAYING"), 3:81])))))
---

##You should now have your final data frame
print(completedf3)
