"completedf3" is the file with the final completed data frame

"run_analysis.R" is the R script with the code to make the data frame. One thing to note is that my working directory is different from yours. My working directory is "~/Emekas Documents/R-Directory/" so you should replace that part of the code with your working directory. The rest should be consistent. If you are using R Studio then you can just import the necessary files. They are "activity_labels" and "features" in the first folder. "subject_test", "X_test", and "y_test" in the test folder. "subject_train", "X_train", and "y_train" in the train folder. Once all the files are loaded into R, just run the second half of the code as it is and it should work fine.

"detailed_run_analysis.R" has the same code as run_analysis.R but it is broken up by sections and has annotations describing what exactly is going on with the code. You can use that file to run the code step by step if you prefer.
