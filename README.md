"completedf3" is the file with the final completed data frame

"run_analysis.R" is the R script with the code to make the data frame. Once the UCI folder in your working directory, you can just cope the entire code and run it in R. It should take about a minute to run the entire thing.

"detailed_run_analysis.R" is a file with the same code as sun_analysis.R, but it is broken up into smaller parts with details on what exactly is happening. You can use that version if you prefer to see it step by step, but it isn't necessary.
